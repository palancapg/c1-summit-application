Basic Written Run of Application:
---------------------------------
1. User will input a movie title that is non-cap-sensitive (required field but catch if none is imputed)
2. After the user presses the submit button it will display the movie in a user friendly way with the details of the release date, runtime, genre, and director of the movie.

Basic Application Algorithm:
----------------------
* Program will take in a total of 1 input from the user
* String query *required field* - can be a movie that can be non-cap-sensitive
* If field is NOT put in the user will be notified that a field needs to be put in
* If field is put in and submitted it will then use that string as a query to put into the API
* From there it wil display a list of movies that are populated from the call to API from query
* If a the user then clicks on the "Click for More Details" button on a movie, it will grab extra details regarding specific movie
* User can now transverses through list of movies by clicking on the number buttons representing buttons at the button of list
